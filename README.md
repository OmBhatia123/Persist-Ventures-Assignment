# Creating Automatic GIFs from Videos

The script converts videos into GIFs. It has a function 'video_to_gif' that takes a video file, selects a segment of it, and saves it as a GIF. Another function, 'process_videos_in_directory', processes all videos in a specified directory, converting them to GIFs. It checks if the directory exists and then processes each video file found. If there are errors during conversion, it prints an error message. This setup helps automate creating GIFs from multiple video files in a folder.

**NOTE:** After running the code, the GIFs will be created automatically but will be visible only after about 5 minutes.
